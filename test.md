## Overview
This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for basic syntax and extended syntax.

## Basic Syntax
These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Heading | ```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
``` |
| Bold | `**bold text**` |
